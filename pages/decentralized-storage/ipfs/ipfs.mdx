The Internet has become an essential tool for our daily lives, used for media consumption, communication, learning, managing finances, and more. However, the web as we know it has a problem: data centralization. Everything is stored on large servers, typically controlled by a single company. This centralization leads to issues like censorship and single points of failure.

> **Technical Insight 💡:** The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) aims to solve these problems by creating a completely distributed web using peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, similar to BitTorrent. It shifts from "location-based addressing" to "content-based addressing". Each file has a unique hash, and when you want to download a file, you ask the network: "who has the file with this hash?" This approach ensures built-in security and efficient network operation by eliminating duplication.

IPFS also takes into account different versions of your files, creating a new "commit object" for each version. This makes IPFS an immutable database, much like a blockchain. However, IPFS has its limitations. The biggest challenge is keeping files available. If all nodes storing a specific file go offline, the file becomes unavailable. 

Filecoin, created by the same people behind IPFS, is a blockchain built on IPFS aiming to create a decentralized storage market. It incentivizes nodes to keep files online as long as possible and ensures files are duplicated across multiple nodes to prevent unavailability.

> **Curiosity 🧐:** IPFS has been used in real-world applications to circumvent censorship. For instance, when the Turkish government blocked access to Wikipedia in 2017, the people behind IPFS responded by putting a copy of Turkish Wikipedia on IPFS. Since IPFS is distributed and there's no central server, the government couldn't block it.

IPFS could even be used to distribute parts of the internet between multiple planets, hence its name "Interplanetary File System". For example, if we had a base on Mars, a large part of the internet could be stored on Mars using IPFS. This would allow for much faster access to web pages, as the data wouldn't have to travel between Earth and Mars.
