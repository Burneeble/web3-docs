The Internet has become an essential tool in our daily lives. We use it for media consumption, communication, learning, managing our finances, and more. However, the web as we know it has a problem: data centralization. Everything is stored on large servers, usually controlled by a single company. 

> **Technical Insight üí°:** The current web model is based on "location-based addressing". This means that when you want to download a file, you tell your computer where to find it. If the server is offline, you won't get the file, even if someone else has downloaded it before and still has a copy.

This centralization leads to another issue: censorship. Since data is available on only a few servers, it's easy for a government to block access. For instance, in 2017, Turkey ordered ISPs to block access to Wikipedia, considering it a "threat to national security".

But why do we continue to use this model? It's because we have high expectations for the web. We want instant, high-quality pages, images, and videos. Centralized servers allow companies to control the speed of content delivery. Another reason is that there isn't a fast alternative. But that could change!

Meet **IPFS**, the Interplanetary File System. It aims to make the web completely distributed using P2P networks, similar to BitTorrent. 

> **Curiosity üßê:** IPFS is named "Interplanetary File System" because it could potentially work between different planets. For instance, if we had a base on Mars, IPFS could be used to distribute parts of the internet there, reducing the time it takes to load a webpage from Earth.

**IPFS** switches from "location-based addressing" to "content-based addressing". Instead of telling your computer where to find a resource, you just tell it what you want. Each file has a unique hash, like a fingerprint. When you want to download a file, you ask the network: "Who has the file with this hash?" and someone on the IPFS network will provide it.

**IPFS** also takes into account different versions of your files. When you update a file, IPFS creates a new "commit object" for you. This object tells IPFS which commit came before and links it to your file's IPFS object. This process can be repeated endlessly, ensuring that your file and its entire history are accessible to other network nodes.

However, **IPFS** has its limitations. The biggest problem is keeping files available. Each network node caches the files it has downloaded and makes them available to others. But if a specific file is kept by a few nodes and they go offline, the file becomes unavailable. 

**Filecoin**, created by the same people behind **IPFS**, is trying to solve this problem. It's a blockchain built on IPFS aiming to create a decentralized storage market. If you have free space, you can rent it to others and earn money. Filecoin encourages nodes to keep files online as long as possible, as they won't get a reward otherwise.

In conclusion, **IPFS** is an ambitious project that could lead us towards a truly decentralized internet.
