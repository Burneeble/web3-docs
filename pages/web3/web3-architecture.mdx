# Architecture of Web3:

> Explain the architecture model of Web3, including the concepts of decentralization, transparency, and resistance to censorship.

The architecture model of Web3 revolves around the **core principles** of _decentralization, transparency, and resistance to censorship_. These principles are achieved through the integration of blockchain technology and other decentralized protocols.

### Core ideas of Web3

Web3’ll all be built on blockchains, “special computers that anyone can access but no one owns.” Here a few core principles guide Web3 creation.

- Web3 is **decentralized**, instead of large swathes of the internet controlled and owned by centralized entities ownership gets distributed amongst its builders and users;
- Web3 is **permissionless**, everyone has equal access to participate in Web3, and no one gets excluded;
- Web3 has **native payments**, because it uses cryptocurrency for spending and sending money online instead of relying on the outdated infrastructure of banks and payment processors;
- Web3 is **trustless**, it operates using incentives and economic mechanisms instead of relying on trusted third-parties.

## Web3 Core Principles VS Tradition

### 1️⃣ Decentralization

Decentralization is a fundamental pillar of Web3's architecture. Traditional web infrastructure relies on centralized servers controlled by a single entity or organization. In contrast, Web3 distributes data and computing power across a **peer-to-peer network of nodes**, removing the need for central authorities or intermediaries.

- **_Blockchain Technology:_** Blockchain is at the heart of Web3's decentralization. It is a decentralized and immutable ledger that records transactions across a network of nodes. Each node stores a copy of the blockchain, and transactions are validated through consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.
- **_Distributed Data Storage:_** In Web3, data is distributed and stored across multiple nodes, ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance. Decentralized storage systems like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) are often used to store files and content in a distributed manner.
- **_Peer-to-Peer Communication:_** Web3 applications enable direct peer-to-peer communication without intermediaries. Users can interact and exchange data without relying on centralized servers, enhancing privacy and security.

### 2️⃣ Transparency

Transparency is a key characteristic of Web3's architecture. In traditional systems, data and processes are often hidden behind centralized authorities, leading to a lack of trust and accountability. Web3, on the other hand, ensures **transparency** through its decentralized and public nature.

- **_Immutable Transactions:_** Transactions recorded on the blockchain are immutable and transparent. Once added to the blockchain, data cannot be altered or deleted, providing a verifiable and auditable history of transactions.
- **_Public Ledgers:_** Blockchains are public ledgers, accessible to anyone on the network. Anyone can view and verify transactions, enhancing trust and removing the need for intermediaries to validate information.
- **_Open-Source Development:_** Web3 applications are often open-source, allowing users to inspect the code and ensure its integrity. This transparency fosters community collaboration and ensures the absence of hidden functionalities or backdoors.

### 3️⃣Resistance to Censorship

Web3 architecture is designed to resist censorship and control by centralized entities. Traditional web systems are susceptible to censorship, where certain information or services can be restricted or blocked. Web3 aims to create a **more open and uncensored internet** environment.

- **_Decentralized Content Hosting:_** Content hosted on IPFS or similar decentralized systems is resistant to censorship. Since the content is distributed across multiple nodes, it becomes challenging for any single entity to take it down.
- **_Permissionless Participation:_** Web3 applications often allow permissionless participation, meaning anyone can join the network and interact without requiring approval from a central authority.
- **_No Single Points of Failure:_** Decentralization in Web3 eliminates single points of failure, making it harder for governments or central authorities to shut down or control access to the network.

## 🏁 In Conclusion 🎉

Web3's architecture model emphasizes decentralization, transparency, and resistance to censorship. By leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized protocols, Web3 aims to create a **more democratic, secure, and open internet ecosystem,** empowering users with greater control over their data and interactions.
